# ubiquitous-octo-computing-machine
A Python project template

## Introduction

Feel free to fork this project for your needs. You might want to check out the `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and enable GPU base image in case that's your jam. Also, testing is set up with a no-op test in `tests`. This repo provides a installable package with a entry point as defined in `setup.cfg`. There are a couple of vscode tasks defined for AWS and GitHub automation as well as a debug launch profile.
